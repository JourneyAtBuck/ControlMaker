Control Maker v1.0
Created by Moses Journey. Questions or comments? email me at ControlMaker@mrjourney.net.

A controller icon browser. Based on the LaunchPad.jsx script by Jeff of the After Effects crew.

Notes: This browser creates buttons for all .ai files located in the selected folder, which you can change by clicking the '...' button; subfolders are not scanned. If you place a 15x15 or smaller PNG file in the same folder and with the same base name as the Illustrator file (with a .png extension, e.g., hand.png for the hand.ai file), the PNG file will be used as an icon button to import the associated .ai file. 

Hold CTRL while clicking one of the icon buttons for extended features: if you have puppet pins selected, will create expressions on each pin linking their position to their respective controls; if you have multiple layers selected, will create one control in the center.

You can use this browser as a dockable panel by placing it in a ScriptUI Panels subfolder of the controls folder, and then choosing the ControlMaker.jsx script from the Window menu.
